RFID and Keypad Door lock and Alert System using Arduino:

- Upon scanning the right RFID tag and entering the right passcode, it will open the door and send a confirmation message otherwise it will send an alert message to the phone.
- You can halt the system by sending a ‘close’ message to Arduino and it will only go back to normal mode when you will send the ‘open’ message to Arduino. During halt time, it won’t scan any tags and it will only look for messages.
